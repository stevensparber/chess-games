# Analyzing My Online Chess Games in R

This repository consists of an R Markdown file I created to explore a year and a half of my online chess games in the Lichess platform. I take a raw "pgn" (portable game notation) file, which consists of a single column of unstructured information covering ~2.6K games and turn it into a data frame with almost 100 different variables detailing piece moves, castling, player rating differences, previous results and more.

My aim with this analysis was to discover patterns in my own play and see which factors may be related to winning games. My full analysis, including my research questions, findings, data cleaning, data exploration and predictive modeling can be found in my blog post: https://www.stevensparber.com/projects/analyzing-online-chess-games-r.
